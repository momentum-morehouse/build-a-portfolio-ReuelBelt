    <p> I made this page after completing a tutorial in Khan Academy.<br>
        What I enjoyed most was learning about some interesting places in Mozambique.<br>
        It was also cool to practice using CSS.

    <p>This is the second webpage I have created and the first in <strong>VS Code.</strong><br>
        Working with Rebecca, Mari and the rest of our Cohort has been great.<br>
        We all have different skill sets and bring different point-of-views.<br>
        Tina has introduced our official cohort dance "the Cabbage patch" <br>
        to celebrate <strong>WINS!!</strong><br>
